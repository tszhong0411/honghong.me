```tsx
<ScrollArea className='h-[200px] w-[350px] rounded-md border p-4'>
  Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving jokes all over the
  place: under the king's pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but
  he couldn't seem to stop Jokester. And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that
  the jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And once they started
  laughing, they couldn't stop.
</ScrollArea>
```
