I am a student. In order to challenge new things I start learning web development in December 2020. I found [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja) on Youtube and learn Web development from it. I have over 1 year of web development experience :)

I like to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) React Components Library and [Github](https://github.com/) to save the source code and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy my website.

❤️ I love playing video
games, develop website, and learning programming.
